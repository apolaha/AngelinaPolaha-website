                <div class="main">

                    <p1 class="p1"> My name is Angelina Polaha and I am from a suburb outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Originally, I was born in New Jersey which is just a state away. However, my parents decided to move to Pennsylvania because it was closer 
                                    to more family. I have many cousins which is a lot of fun especially because we grew up within a mile from eachother. Having a lot of cousins made it fun growing up because we
                                    all went to the same schools. I come from a big town with a big public school. I have four brothers (yes that is a lot of brothers!) and I am the only girl smacked right in the middle. My siblings and I are super close
                                    and I feel like they are also my best friends. Having so many relatives live close when I was younger, I wanted to go to a school where I knew no one. I felt like I needed to get out of this bubble that I grew up in to meet new people. I chose Elon because I wanted to go to a smaller school
                                    far away from home to get out of the bubble I grew up in. As a child, I had many hobbies. I was a very busy child with many different sports. I played tennis, swim, karate, fieldhockey, and ballet. The sports that stuck with me as I got older were swimming, tennis, and fieldhockey. 
                    </p1>

                    <p2 class="p2">  Going to school at Elon University, has made me gain some more hobbies. I have a lot of hobbies that I complete everyday here at Elon University. Some of my favorite hobbies are cleaning my room, cooking, doing my laundry, and taking long walks as a source of exercise.
                      I also enjoy hanging out with different groups of friends. I have hometown friends, highschool friends, new friends, sorority friends and even friends in frats. My favorite things to do with all my friends is going out to eat.
                        I also enjoy going on night drives with the windows down and the music blasting. I love having so many different friends with different personalities because they make me who I am. It is cool having people in my life that have a lot
                        of similarities to me and also a lot of differences. </p1>
                
                        <p3 class="p3">  I have been through a lot of ups and downs this year. The ups have been meeting new friends and living off campus. I live in an apartment with all seniors and they have become my close friends. They hold me accountable 
                            and make sure I go to class. Some downs is that I am not living with my super close friends. I also live a little far from school which makes it hard to go to class. Overall, my time here at Elon has been amazing because I meet new people
                            daily and get to experience a step further to real life. </p2>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="footer">Overall, my time here at Elon has been amazing and has been a big change compared to living at home. I have learned a lot about myself being here and more of what I like and more interests I have. I have been open to trying new things 
                                which has allowed me to go outside of my comfort zone. I hope the rest of my time here at Elon is beneficial to me and I continue my hobbies and continue doing what I love around on campus.
